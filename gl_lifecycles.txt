getAttribLocation - just an index of attrib inside a particular shader program
in every shader program starts with 0

enableVertexAttribArray - global, does not require bound buffer
vertexAttribPointer - assign addr or the current buffer to the global pointer
bufferData - writes stuff to the currently bound buffer

Does not matter when useProgram is called relative to buffer setup,
as long as it's before drawArrays.
